Hi, this is Jiude Wei, an undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was enrolled in the first session of [Guozhi Class](http://www.qingyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/c/Introductiongzb). Now I work as a research intern at [MVIG lab](https://www.mvig.org/) where I cowork with Jianhua Sun and Yuxuan Li, supervised by Prof. Cewu Lu. I have great research interest in 3D vision, robotics and specifically embodied AI.
