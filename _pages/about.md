<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year M.S. student at School of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
Previously, I got my B.Eng. degree in artificial intelligence at SJTU. I was enrolled in the first session of [Guozhi Class](http://www.qingyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/c/Introductiongzb). 

I am currently a member of [MVIG](https://www.mvig.org/). I am adviced by [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and [Prof. Jianhua Sun](https://gothicai.github.io/HomePage/). I have great research interest in 3D vision, robotics and specifically embodied AI.

[Arti-PG: A Toolbox for Procedurally Synthesizing Large-Scale and Diverse Articulated Objects with Rich Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14974)

Jianhua Sun<sup>\*</sup>, Yuxuan Li<sup>\*</sup>, **Jiude Wei**<sup>\*</sup>, Longfei Xu, Nange Wang, Yining Zhang, Cewu Lu<sup>¬ß</sup>

[\[**Paper**\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14974)

We propose the Articulated Object Procedural Generation (Arti‚ÄëPG) toolbox, which synthesizes diverse and unlimited articulated objects with rich annotations through program‚Äëoriented structure manipulation and analytic label alignment, addressing the scarcity of high‚Äëquality articulated object data and annotations.

[\[**Paper**\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11702)

We present AOT and the AOT-driven baseline AOTNet to empower machine intelligence with the kind of human capability to understand and then interact with articulated objects, espeically the novel ones, at the conceptual level for the first time.
